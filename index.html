            A great content plan is the most important step in creating an engaging website. It's where you map out the copy, imagery and structure you need so your team knows what to design and build.

            But often, the planning is done in isolation. The copy is written in a Google Doc, the images are stored in a Dropbox folder and the Sitemap resides in a spreadsheet. It's hard for anyone on the team to see how it all fits together. A visual content plan solves all this and lets you plan everything in one place so your team and client have a clear vision for your new website.

            This template is part of the Website Design collection.
